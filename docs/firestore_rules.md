# Firestore security rules\n\nThe app restricts access to Firestore user data so each authenticated user can only read and write their own `/users/{uid}` document.\n\n## Running the emulator rule tests locally\n\nPrerequisites:\n- Node 18+\n- npm\n\nSteps:\n1. Install the rule test dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   cd rules-tests\n   npm install\n   ```\n2. Run the rule tests (uses the in-process Firestore emulator provided by `@firebase/rules-unit-testing`):\n   ```bash\n   npm test\n   ```\n\nThe tests cover allow/deny cases for:\n- Creating and reading your own profile document.\n- Blocking access to other users' documents.\n- Blocking unauthenticated access.\n\nThe rules live in `firestore.rules` and are referenced by `firebase.json`.\n*** End Patch
